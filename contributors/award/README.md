# Karmada Community Annual Contribution Awards

The Karmada Community Annual Contribution Awards are an annual recognition program established by the Karmada community to acknowledge and thank individuals and organizations that have made outstanding contributions to the community and the project over the past year. The awards recognize two categories: **Annual Contributors** (individual contributors) and **Annual Contributing Organizations** (companies/organizations that support the community). The selection is conducted by a community **Selection Committee** based on contribution statistics and nominations.

## Selection Committee

The Selection Committee is responsible for nominations and voting, ensuring that the process is fair, impartial, and transparent.

### Committee composition

The Selection Committee consists of:

- Karmada Community [Maintainers](https://github.com/karmada-io/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md)

Committee members should remain objective and impartial, and evaluate nominees based on their actual contributions.

## Awards

The Karmada Community Annual Contribution Awards include two awards, recognizing individuals and organizations that have made notable contributions to community building and project development.

### 1. Annual Contributor

Thank you to individual contributors who actively participate and contribute consistently in the community.

- **Quota**: 10 recipients (adjustable based on actual needs)
- **Who**: Individuals who have made important contributions to the Karmada community, including but not limited to code contributions, documentation improvements, community operations, and technical evangelism.

**Recognition and gifts**:
1. Official Karmada community announcement
2. Annual Contributor certificate (electronic)
3. Community swag (the specific form may vary by year)

### 2. Annual Contributing Organization

Thank you to organizations that continue to invest resources and actively support the growth of the Karmada project.

**Recognition**:

2. Annual Contributing Organization certificate (electronic)

## Eligibility

Every contribution matters, no matter how big or small. We recognize that people and organizations support Karmada in many different ways, and we value them all.

### Who can be nominated as an individual contributor?

You don't need to check all the boxes—excelling in any of these areas makes you a great candidate:

**Quality contributions**
- Writing clean, well-designed code
- Creating clear and helpful documentation
- Proposing thoughtful features and improvements

**Community impact**
- Giving talks or writing about Karmada
- Sharing real-world adoption stories
- Mentoring newcomers and helping others learn
- Contributing to the broader cloud-native ecosystem

**Being a great community member**
- Helping others troubleshoot issues
- Jumping into discussions with constructive ideas
- Reviewing PRs and providing helpful feedback
- Sharing knowledge and experience generously

> **Note**: Maintainers are already recognized as core project stewards. To spotlight more contributors, these awards focus on outstanding community members who aren't currently maintainers.

### What makes an organization a great nominee?

Organizations can make a big difference too. Here's what we look for (again, excelling in any area counts):
**Resource commitment**
- Supporting engineers to contribute their time
- Providing infrastructure, testing environments, or other resources

**Ecosystem impact**
- Sharing production use cases and success stories
- Building tools or integrations that benefit the community
- Driving adoption and innovation

**Active participation**
- Engaging in community discussions and events
- Responding to issues and helping solve problems
- Contributing constructively to the project's direction

## Selection Process

The selection is nomination-based. The process is open and transparent: the criteria, process, and results are shared with the community and open to community oversight.

Selection Committee members should remain objective and impartial, and evaluate nominees based on their actual contributions, without being influenced by any external factors.

### Timeline

- **Kickoff**: Early December
- **Nomination period**: Mid-December to mid-January (approximately 4 weeks)
- **Voting period**: 2 weeks
- **Announcement**: Late January

The exact dates will be announced when the selection process begins each year.

> **Note**: The nomination period extends into January to allow time for contribution data to be fully updated and reflected in our systems, ensuring accurate recognition of all contributions made throughout the year.

### Nomination

Nominations are conducted publicly via issues in the [community](https://github.com/karmada-io/community/issues) repository. Separate issues will be created for the two awards, and community members are welcome to participate and provide oversight.

There is no limit on the number of nominees during the nomination period. We welcome and encourage nominations for outstanding contributors and organizations.

**Who can nominate**

- Community members (including Selection Committee members) may nominate any contributor/organization, or self-nominate.

**How to nominate**

Nominate an Annual Contributor or an organization in a comment on the issue. One nominee per comment, in the format:

```
Nominee GitHub ID (or organization name) + nomination reason
```

### Voting

The Selection Committee votes through a private online form. Voting closes at the end of the voting period. Members who don't submit votes are considered abstentions.

**Special situations**:
- **Fewer nominees than slots**: All qualified nominees will receive the award
- **Low participation**: At least half of the committee members must vote for the results to be valid

### Announcement

Award recipients will be announced in alphabetical order. Congratulations to all recipients—and thank you for making Karmada better!

Announcements will include:
- Names of award recipients and their organizations
- Highlights of their contributions
- Publication across official Karmada channels (website, blog, social media)
